After some wrestling with our production pipelines last week we managed to release a patch update in the form of [Concourse v3.9.1](https://concourse-ci.org/downloads.html#v391). We’ve fixed some of the reported bugs from the previous release (3.9.0) so definitely go and check it out!

I don’t have much else regarding updates this week so here’s a fun fact for you to chew on: did you know that Concourse uses Concourse to deploy Concourse? Its true!
