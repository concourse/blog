It's the May 2025 project update! I'm going to try and do this at a somewhat regular cadence. Once a month seems like a good idea, though I may skip a month here and there if there's nothing interesting to write about.

# Administrative

I've opened up a [discussion thread](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/discussions/9184) about the breaking changes currently planned to go into v8 of Concourse. Nothing is set in stone, all feedback is welcome! Likely the most disruptive one so far is to finally enforce the [valid identifiers](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/discussions/9184#discussioncomment-13077550) instead of warning when they're detected. See the link for full details and reasoning.

The [Concourse Working Group](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/working-groups/concourse.md) has been meeting once per month. You can view past meetings on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_XoNsUtX-Y&list=PLhuMOCWn4P9ji8ZCY2a-FvMeT7S74-Hhm) and view [meeting notes here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KSp7npDEARGbsp5SmB2DHp4VJCEJ0GAqYwv9ixHH2DI/).

The last thing I want to mention is that I decided to step away from [CentralCI](https://centralci.com/). They are still operating and working at making a fantastic managed Concourse that you can go and buy right now!!! If you want Concourse but don't want the overhead of running it, I highly recommend reaching out to them. I will be focusing my time on the community and those currently running Concourse on-premise.

If you want to support my work stewarding Concourse you can [sponsor me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/taylorsilva). Thank you to those who already found the page and are sponsoring me ðŸ’™

# Roadmap

I have two project boards that I'm using to track work right now.

- [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/concourse/projects/53)
- [Pull Requests](https://github.com/orgs/concourse/projects/54)

The Roadmap board is tracking work that I am actively working on and planning to work on next. Right now the ARM build stuff is taking up most of my time. I have to update some of the tooling we use to build images (the registry-image resource and oci-build task) to make it easier to build and push multi-arch images. I'm also taking the time to clean up a bunch of stuff in the [concourse/ci](https://github.com/concourse/ci) repo. It's a lot of work but it's slowly happening. I see no major roadblocks with this work right now.

The Pull Requests board is a place for me to see all open pull requests across all repositories. I've added most open PR's to this board. If you see your PR on this board, that means I'm aware of it and I'll get to it eventually.

# S3 Resource Type

I made a few breaking changes with the [S3 resource type](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource) that came out with 7.13. The [v2.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource/releases/tag/v2.0.0) go over those. I did not hit the mark with these changes sadly. Users found that they couldn't pull down items from public S3 buckets. Resources pulling from public buckets were using no credentials previously, but with v2 they now tried to use any credentials the default SDK authentication chain could find, which usually ended up being an EC2 instance profile. I then made a [PR](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource/pull/187) to fix this, but then that made it, again, impossible for users to use the EC2 instance profile. Fritz then made a [PR](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource/pull/189) that adds a new flag to the S3 resource, `enable_aws_creds_provider`, which allows the behaviour introduced in v2 to happen if you want it to. 

I published a new version of the resource type with this PR, [v2.2.0](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource/releases/tag/v2.2.0). If you want to use that in your pipelines you can do so with this snippet:

```yaml
resource_types:
- name: s3
  type: registry-image
  source:
    repository: docker.io/concourse/s3-resource
    tag: 2.2.0
```

That will override the S3 resource type found on the worker for pipelines that you add this to. Apologies again for the blunder and thank you to those who helped get the resource back in a state that works for everyone.

# VS Code Extension

Shouting this out as it looks handy. A user made a VS code extension for previewing Concourse pipelines. You can see their post where that shared that here: https://github.com/concourse/concourse/discussions/9193

# Cloud Foundry Day North America

[Cloud Foundry Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cloud-foundry-day-north-america/) is happening next week on May 14th. Derek (my co-lead of the Concourse working group) [has a talk](https://sched.co/1xAEo) about Concourse's journey into the Cloud Foundry foundation. Make sure you check it out and say hi to Derek if you'll be there.

# That's All Folks!

And that's the update! If anyone wants to chat I'm always hanging around on [discord](https://discord.gg/MeRxXKW). You can also reach me at `dev` at `taydev.net`.
