If you havenâ€™t heard the news by now, we released Concourse v3.9.0 this week ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰! Two of the top-line features in this release are:

- Concourse will now automatically propagate certificates from the worker machine into resource containers (GH issue [#1027](http://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1027))
- Improved btrfs volume driver stability. So if youâ€™re getting hit hard by overlay weirdness, Iâ€™d suggest you give the btrfs driver another shot!

To find out what else weâ€™ve packed into this release, Iâ€™d encourage you to read the full release notes on the [concourse.ci/downloads](https://concourse-ci.org/downloads.html#v390) page!

On to the update...

## **Features**

**UX**

- Started to look at slow page-load times on the web-ui. The team identified that a large source of the pain came when we introduced timestamps last year. Weâ€™ve since been able to drastically improve the load times on that page [GH issue 1912](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1912)

**Runtime**

- As I mentioned last week, the Concourse team runs a relatively large installation of Concourse that is used by Pivotal employees for internal projects. As a result of running this giant Concourse, weâ€™ve discovered that our Garbage Collector needs significant improvement in order to keep up with the workloads that weâ€™ve been observing. GH issue [#2016](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2016) has been consuming a lot of our thoughts and feelings this week.

**Core**

- Same as last week: continued breaking out our backend auth systems to use Dex [#1888](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1888), (see [#1886](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1886)for additional background)
- ^^ Refactoring our complex backend to support individual auth is going to take some time, and we recognize that :)

## Design Research

Weâ€™ve picked up design research work on Spatial Resources again. [Lindsay Auchinachie](https://medium.com/u/d3a12206d051) and [Sam Peinado](https://medium.com/u/8a529ac5b818) are currently exploring different ways to visualize the (potentially) dense permutations and combinations of work.
