[Topher Bullock](https://medium.com/u/58876cdc2180), [Lindsay Auchinachie](https://medium.com/u/84b937bda3b6), [Alex Suraci](https://medium.com/u/263a63b2f209) and I will be travelling to San Francisco next week to attend the [SpringOne Platform 2017](https://springoneplatform.io/) Conference. Not only are there a lot of exciting Spring talks this year, but there will be a lot of CI/CD talks from some amazing speakers.

Unfortunately none of the Concourse core contribution team will be speaking at SpringOne this year; but that doesn’t mean there’s a shortage of Concourse-related talks. Here’s a short list of talks from people who will be sharing their real-world Concourse knowledge and experiences at SpringOne:
