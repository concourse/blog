In case you missed it, I’d encourage you to check out some of the recent posts from [Shashwathi Reddy](https://medium.com/u/bca2c0ffce5e) on “[My first month on Concourse](https://medium.com/concourse-ci/my-first-month-on-concourse-a75f72d21487)” and [Joshua Winters](https://medium.com/u/d6d52be6c4b0) regarding upcoming changes to our authentication; “[Oh, Auth](https://medium.com/concourse-ci/oh-auth-f4fe68438171)”. We’d love to hear your feedback!

Heads up: the Concourse team will be taking Monday May 21st off for [Victoria Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Day)holiday.

And now, on to the update:

**Core**

- Continued banging our heads against new auth connectors with Dex. **Note:** We’ve started to centralize backwards-(in)compatibilities with user auth in issue [#2218](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2218)
- We’ve stood up a new Concourse with our experimental Spaces work. We’re looking for volunteers who are interested in trying out their pipelines before and after “space”. Tweet at me if you’re interested [https://twitter.com/pioverpi](https://twitter.com/pioverpi)!

**Runtime**

- Completed all the volume collection work for distributed GC in [#1959](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1959). We’re currently deploying this change to our internal environments to see how it works at scale 🤞
- Fixed issue [#2168](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2168), wherein “Duplicate resource type volumes created over time”
