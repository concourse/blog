This week the team got together to discuss the initial groundwork and investigations required to publish and maintain a supported API. If you’ve built any tools against our API and have feedback for us, please let us know by commenting on the original [issue #1122](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1122).

In another interesting update, the [PivNet](https://network.pivotal.io/) team has published an update to the [pivnet-resource](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivnet-resource) so “you **no longer need to specify the access key, secret access key, bucket and region** for creating releases.” If you use that resource, you should definitely check it out!

On to the update:

**UX**

- Picked up the story for pinning versions of resources in the web UI [#2508](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2508)

**Core**

- Continued our work on resources v2 and spatial resources with [#2651](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2651)

**Runtime**

- Picked up failing tests in Testflight/Watsjs [#2719](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2719)
- Started work on retry / read deadline for Volume Streaming [#2676](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2676)

**Operations**
