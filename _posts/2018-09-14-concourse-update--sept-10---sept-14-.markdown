Following up from a discussion on our forums [Scott Foerster](https://medium.com/u/86d0fa097bb9) has been looking at different options for selling Concourse swag online. Do you want Concourse leggings? or maybe a limited edition @vito pls pillow! Let us know in the thread [Concourse merchandising](https://discuss.concourse-ci.org/t/concourse-merchandising-t-shirts-and-similar/599/4).

**Please also take some time to fill out our** [**2018 Concourse Community survey**](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLScWHuP130rJAcqBJhQtyIUCqbMcY4Qj0beHtfOnWEQugWSuUw/viewform) **.** Your feedback is really valuable to us and the information you provide will help us plan the future of Concourse. We only have a handful of responses so far and we’d like to get more before we publish the results!

On to the update:

**API**

- As a welcome back to [Joshua Winters](https://medium.com/u/d6d52be6c4b0), we took a look at [#2463](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2463) and the possibility of doing an internal redirect for all auth components. Unfortunately, that didn’t work quite well. Check out the full issue thread for details
- Remember that[RBAC RFC](https://github.com/concourse/rfcs/pull/6)? Well, we’re going to buckle down and start working on that now

**UX**

- Following up on issue [#2427](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2427), we’re applying the same labelling principals to the HD dashboard view in [#2572](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2572)

**Core**

- Kept hacking away on good ol’[#2386](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2386)

**Runtime**

- Spiking on [#2581](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2581), where we ask ourselves “Can we determine when a build step fails because the worker is unusable?”

**Operations**

- Continuing on [#2312](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2312). This issue has exploded a bit to lots of edge cases and race conditions; but our determination to finish this issue is strong
- Looked into why our [k8s-testflight](https://ci.concourse-ci.org/teams/main/pipelines/main/jobs/k8s-testflight/builds/114) job keeps breaking.
