I’ve gotten some questions about Freedom Friday from some readers after last week’s update. Well it turns out that[Topher Bullock](https://medium.com/u/58876cdc2180) wrote a great article about it this week; you read up on it here: [https://medium.com/concourse-ci/freedom-fridays-319204dea834](https://medium.com/concourse-ci/freedom-fridays-319204dea834)

We also release [Concourse v3.13.0](https://concourse-ci.org/download.html) earlier this week. Make sure you check it out if you were hit by the accumulating logs issue introduced in v3.12.0.

On to the update:

## **Space**

We’ve been building out some of the frontend code for representing Spaces as part of [#2131](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2131). You can see some of the early visualizations below:

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src=" __GHOST_URL__ /content/images/downloaded_images/Concourse-Update--April-30---May-4-/1-K13pFduQtcsPeX3VH6crQQ.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src=" __GHOST_URL__ /content/images/downloaded_images/Concourse-Update--April-30---May-4-/1-_ndF5rSNwVlKJWTj2_vxUQ.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src=" __GHOST_URL__ /content/images/downloaded_images/Concourse-Update--April-30---May-4-/1-kBELwDyhYQwPchw7J-O0eQ.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>

We now have the capability of testing Space end-to-end i.e. write the yml -\> fly sp -\> check out the web visualization.

EXCITING

## Distributed GC on&nbsp;Workers

We’ve been hacking away on master issue [#1959](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1959) for distributed GC. If you’ve been following along closely you’ll notice that the number of boxes that we’ve checked has increased…and that’s a good thing! We’re in the final stretches of this work and will be prepping to test them in our internal Concourse “Wings” very soon

## User Auth

As always, we continue to work on our User Auth master issue [#1888](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1888). We’ve now transitioned into building out specific auth connectors using the [dex](https://github.com/coreos/dex) library. We’ve completed the GitHub and CF connectors, and are currently working on the generic OAuth provider
