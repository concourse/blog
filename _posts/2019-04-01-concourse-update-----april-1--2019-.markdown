Phew, it‚Äôs been a while since I last wrote an update. For some background behind why I slowed down, hop on over to this thread on our forms: [‚ÄúWhat would you like to see on our blog‚Äù](https://discuss.concourse-ci.org/t/what-kind-of-topics-would-you-like-to-see-on-our-blog/1222/8).

That said, I _do_ have a lot of interesting updates to share, so let‚Äôs get started

## Concourse 5.0.0

In case you missed it, [Concourse 5.0.0](https://concourse-ci.org/download.html#v500) and [5.0.1](https://concourse-ci.org/download.html#v501) came out a few weeks ago in March. This is a major version release with tons of new features, including:

- Role Based Access Control
- Global Resource Cache
- fewest-build-containers placement strategy
- Resource pinning
- Inputs on the put step of a pipeline
- UI tweaks
- and [much much more](https://concourse-ci.org/download.html#v500)!

Be warned, there are some breaking changes in this release as well; so make sure you read [all](https://concourse-ci.org/download.html#v500-note-1) [of](https://concourse-ci.org/download.html#v500-note-2)[the](https://concourse-ci.org/download.html#v500-note-3) [release](https://concourse-ci.org/download.html#v500-note-4) [notes](https://concourse-ci.org/download.html#v500-note-5) [before](https://concourse-ci.org/download.html#v500-note-6) you upgrade!

You‚Äôll also notice that we recently gave the [Concourse homepage](https://concourse-ci.org/)a small makeover as well. We‚Äôve tightened up the navigation and expanded some sections of of our docs, check it out:

- Expanded docs on[Credential Management](https://concourse-ci.org/creds.html) with Vault and AWS SSM
- More info on the new [Container Placement](https://concourse-ci.org/container-placement.html) strategies
- A primer on the new [Global Resources](https://concourse-ci.org/global-resources.html) feature
- Our spiffy new [Examples](https://concourse-ci.org/learning.html#examples) section, which gives you a side-by-side comparison of a pipeline and the yml that made it

## **Interesting Blog&nbsp;Posts**

There‚Äôs also been some interesting blog posts about Concourse from around the interwebs‚Ä¶and not all of them were written by me!

## Concourse Swag
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src=" __GHOST_URL__ /content/images/downloaded_images/Concourse-Update-----April-1--2019-/1-7Ox9ZUESMtTgP-wCg5gaww.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>

We have swag! With the help of the team at Pivotal we‚Äôve listed our first Concourse-branded sweater under the [official Pivotal apparel store](https://store.pivotal.io/collections/all-products/products/pivotal-unisex-crewneck-sweatshirt). A few notes:

- The sweaters themselves are listed at-cost, so we‚Äôre not making any profit off of them
- Apologies to anyone who‚Äôs not in the United States because international shipping through this store is _atrocious_. We‚Äôre going to be working with our partners to see if we can find a better shipping solution.
- At the time of this writing we‚Äôre relatively low on M and L sweaters, there‚Äôs a new shipment of those sizes coming in soon so the store should be updated in a week or so
- Once this batch of sweaters sell out we‚Äôll be planning on doing new designs to keep things fresh!

## Concourse IRL

The Concourse team will be attending CF Summit NA 2019 this week in Philadelphia, so come by the Pivotal booth and say hi to the team!

I‚Äôll also be attending a the ConcourseCI Bay Area User Group meetup on April 11th in Palo Alto. The title of the meetup is [‚ÄúKubernetes Deployments with Concourse CI and Spinnaker‚Äù](https://www.meetup.com/concourse/events/259904171/). Come check it out if you‚Äôre in the bay area!

## Milestones and Interesting RFCs

[Alex Suraci](https://medium.com/u/263a63b2f209) has been experimenting with re-organizing our backlog of epics by using the GitHub Projects feature. You can see our current list of epics in the concourse/concourse[project list](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/projects). The big things we‚Äôre working on are:

- Spatial Resource
- API refactoring
- Ephemeral check containers (Runtime)
- and Concourse + K8s runtime

On the topic of k8s runtime situation, please take a second to review [Topher Bullock](https://medium.com/u/58876cdc2180)‚Äôs new [RFC #22 How Do We Best Leverage K8s as Runtime?](https://github.com/topherbullock/rfcs/blob/e4a80f902bc835b2d528a7550b427bfa83a5660d/008-k8s-runtime/proposal.md). The team is evaluating Concourse + [Tekton CD](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) vs Concourse + K8s our own way.

## Thanks to our Community üôè

Finally, I wanted to give shout outs to our growing community of Concourse fans and followers. In early 2019 the Concourse team made two changes to our contributor workflow: we switched over to a looser Contributors License Agreement (CLA) and the core team moved towards a PR-based workflow. Since then we‚Äôve seen a lot more engagement on the work that we‚Äôve doing, and we‚Äôve also started to see a lot of new PRs coming in!

In 2018, we saw 263 PRs opened against concourse/concourse and its core resources. As of today we already have more than 160 PRs opened by non-Pivots! Some notable PRs that I wanted to

## The Future of Weekly&nbsp;Updates

I‚Äôll do my best to resume the weekly cadence of the project updates. In the meantime, if you have any specific opinions on what kind of blog posts we should right, I‚Äôd suggest you check out this thread on our forums: [‚ÄúWhat would you like to see on our blog‚Äù](https://discuss.concourse-ci.org/t/what-kind-of-topics-would-you-like-to-see-on-our-blog/1222/8)
