If you’ve been experiencing “Aw Snap” errors on Chrome with Concourse 3.13.0 or 3.12.0 we traced the root case to two lines of CSS. This seems to happen only on Chrome 67; so a temporary workaround is to switch over to Chrome [canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html) or use Firefox/Safari/Edge. You can follow along in our discussion at GitHub issue [#2236](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2236)

Now, on to the update

**Runtime**

We were able to successfully test our distributed volume GC collection code on our Wings environment this week. Overall we’ve seen a significant drop in Database Queries and a ~10% decrease in Web CPU usage.

Notice how the Database Queries now look like a sawtooth; this is a result of our new “mark and sweep” GC strategy on workers.

**Core**

In an effort to make our new Users work backwards compatible and downgrade-able, we spent a good chunk of this week figuring out down-migrations. The conversation around this, and the compromises we’ve had to make can be found in Josh’s follow up comment [here](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1888#issuecomment-392958566)

**UX**

We’re still looking for users who would be interested in testing out our new spatial resources view! **Please reach out to me over Twitter or @jma on Discord if you’re interested!**
