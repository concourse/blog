We’re going dark themed for Concourse 4.0.0! In addition to the users work, we’re promoting the Dashboard to the / level to take over the home page. You’ll also notice that we added pipeline play/pause capabilities to the dashboard, NEAT!

To keep things consistent, we’re also propagating our new design to the existing pipeline views. You can play around with this new nav structure on our own CI: [https://ci.concourse-ci.org/](https://ci.concourse-ci.org/)

The team here is also planning to attend OSCON in Portland next week (July 18 &19). Drop by the Pivotal booth to say hi and grab a Concourse sticker!
