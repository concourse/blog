In case you missed it, we’ve made some tweaks to the structure of the website. I’m happy to report that [Alex Suraci](https://medium.com/u/263a63b2f209) drastically improved our site-wide search. This resolves [#181](https://github.com/concourse/docs/issues/181) and we’re all the better for it!

Second, you’ll notice that a lot of the community related comment that was on our homepage has now been moved to our [Concourse GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/wiki). We hope this change will make contributor and community specific content more discoverable and more maintainable over time.

Notably, the [Resource Types](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/wiki/Resource-Types), [Tutorials&nbsp;](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/wiki/Tutorials), and [Tools](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/wiki/Tools) page has moved over to the wiki. Content that may be new to some of you include the Project Management section: [How Issues are Managed](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/wiki/How-Issues-are-Managed), [How to Process PRs](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/wiki/How-to-Process-PRs), and [Release Process](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/wiki/Release-Process).

On to the update.

### **K8s Runtime**

Bohen and Sameer have been doing some great write-ups on their research. You can get caught up with their latest research in two GitHub issues: [What does k8s offer as a runtime](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3798) and [What does Tekton offer as a runtime](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3797). If you’d like to track along with this project’s movements you can bookmark the K8s Runtime project board here: [https://github.com/concourse/concourse/projects/14](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/projects/14)

### UX

The Sidebar is coming back! Check out our latest designs in [#2440](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2440#issuecomment-482133483).

We’ve been looking into a few UI regressions in the web frontend as well. Specifically, [#3745](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3745) and [#3748](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3748) have been moved to the top of the backlog

### Runtime

We’ve been working on [#3607](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3607)and [#3810](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3607) as sub-stories to help with Ephemeral Check Containers [#3424](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3424)

[Divya Dadlani](https://medium.com/u/521c9107181d) has also been thinking a lot more about “Performance benchmarking for Concourse releases” [#3816](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3816). The idea is that we should be a bit more rigorous in tracking how Concourse improves with some of the runtime performance changes. Jump on over to the issue and drop a line if you have any ideas/opinions on this subject.
