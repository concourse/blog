The Concourse team went out to Washington D.C. this week to attend Spring One Platform 2018. Thanks to all the Concourse fans who stopped by to say hi, we really enjoyed meeting ya’ll. All of the talks were recorded and should be uploaded to the [SpringDeveloper](https://www.youtube.com/user/SpringSourceDev/videos) YouTube channel in the coming weeks. Some of the interesting talks to check out are:

- [Extreme Pipelines](https://springoneplatform.io/2018/sessions/extreme-pipelines)
- [Zero to Multicloud](https://springoneplatform.io/2018/sessions/zero-to-multi-cloud) and [Spinnaker and the Distributed Monorepo](https://springoneplatform.io/2018/sessions/spinnaker-and-the-distributed-monorepo)
- …and of course [Draupnir: A story about Managing Concourse in the Enterprise](https://springoneplatform.io/2018/sessions/draupnir-a-story-about-managing-concourse-in-the-enterprise)

You’ll notice that our main pipelines are paused. This is because [Alex Suraci](https://medium.com/u/263a63b2f209) is working away on [#2534](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2534), refactoring our main pipeline to support our new mono-repo structure. This new pipeline is simply called the [concourse](https://ci.concourse-ci.org/teams/main/pipelines/concourse)[pipeline](https://ci.concourse-ci.org/teams/main/pipelines/concourse).

In addition to refactoring the pipeline, [Alex Suraci](https://medium.com/u/263a63b2f209) has been fleshing out the new developer/contributor workflows under our new mono-repo. You can find the new updated information in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

You’ll also notice that we ask whether you are reporting a bug or a new feature when creating issues. This will (hopefully) help get our backlog more organized and reduce the up-front triaging!

**Fly**
